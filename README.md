# üí¨ Loan Application RAG Chatbot

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based chatbot built to answer questions related to past loan applications. It retrieves relevant data from historical loan records and then generates a human-like answer based on the retrieved information.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

The goal was to create an **intelligent Q&A chatbot** that could:
- Understand user queries related to loan applications
- Retrieve the most relevant records from a given dataset
- Generate natural language responses from that data

Example user questions:
- *"How can an unemployed woman get a loan?"*
- *"What is the maximum loan amount a man can take?"*

---

## üöÄ Features

- RAG-based architecture
- Lightweight and fully local (no paid APIs)
- Clean UI with **Streamlit**
- Supports semantic search over tabular loan data
- Uses **SentenceTransformer** for embeddings
- Uses **Flan-T5-Small** for answer generation

## ‚ùó Limitations & My Honest Effort

I aimed to create **GPT-3-like responses**, but I had to make tradeoffs due to limited resources:

| Constraint | Limitation |
|-----------|------------|
| No credits for GPT/Claude/Gemini | Couldn't use advanced APIs |
| No GPU / low-RAM laptop | Couldn't run heavy LLMs like Mistral or Falcon |
| Slow internet | Couldn't download 10GB models |
| CPU only | Limited to small models like Flan-T5-Small |

Despite all this, I:

- Built the full RAG pipeline from scratch.
- Explored both naive and LLM-based generations.
- Handled CSV-to-text conversion, embedding, search, and summarization.
- Maintained a neat UI for non-tech users.

## ‚ú® What Can Be Improved (If Resources Allow)

- Replace Flan-T5 with **GPT-4**, **Claude**, or **Mistral-7B-Instruct**
- Deploy the app via HuggingFace or Render
- Train a custom model on domain-specific vocabulary
- Add feedback-based learning loop

## üí° Conclusion

This project is a complete proof-of-concept for a document-aware chatbot. While the responses are limited by the model size, the architecture is robust and extensible for production-grade systems.
